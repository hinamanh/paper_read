### `r colorize("Enrichment Bayesian design for randomized clinical trials using categorical biomarkers and a binary outcome.[@vinnat2022]", "deeppink")`

**Objective**. This study proposed a Bayesian adaptive trial combined with the consideration of subgroup. The objective is to detecting the therapeutic intervention AND identify subset of subjects who respond better to the experimental therapy. 

**Literature review**. The study introduced two preceding studies, where a subset selection criterion was used in the former based on the posterior measure of influence of the treatment;[@morita2014] The later used  the posterior treatment-by-subset interaction.[@millen2014] Author would combine both criteria and concluded the result was likely better. 

**Methodology**. Technically, each subgroup categorized by the specific variable (target or biomarker) was assessed based on the measure of influence and the measure of interaction (involving qualitative & quantitative interaction).[@gail1985] specific-subgroup effect size was evaluated along with the overall effect size (no interacted). Decision rules were specified based on pre-defined thresholds.

**Results**. Results were derived from simulations with multiple scenarios implying the number of subgroups.
